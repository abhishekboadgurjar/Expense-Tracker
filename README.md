## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will create an **Expense Tracker Web Application** using **React**. This project will help you understand state management, event handling, and dynamic list updates in React. It’s ideal for beginners aiming to strengthen their knowledge of React development by building a practical and useful application.

## Project Overview

The Expense Tracker application allows users to keep track of their income and expenses. It helps manage financial data by categorizing and calculating income, expenses, and the total balance. This project showcases the use of React for managing state and handling user input efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Transactions**: Users can add income or expense transactions.
- **Track Balance**: Users can view their total balance and track changes dynamically.
- **Delete Transactions**: Users can remove transactions from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Transactions are persisted across page reloads using `localStorage`.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: To build the user interface and manage component state.
- **CSS**: To style the application.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the application's core logic.
